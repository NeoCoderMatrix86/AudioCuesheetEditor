### Reporting Bugs

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started AudioCuesheetEditor, e.g. which browser you use. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that AudioCuesheetEditor crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace if possible.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of AudioCuesheetEditor are you using?** You can find the version in the "About" page.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running AudioCuesheetEditor in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Are you using AudioCuesheetEditor with multiple monitors?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
* **Which keyboard layout are you using?** Are you using a US layout or some other layout?
